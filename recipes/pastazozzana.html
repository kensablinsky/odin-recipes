  <h2>Recipe from Serious Eats, tastes equally as good using Pancetta in place of Guanciale</h2>
  <h>Ingredients</h>
  <ul>
    <li>3 (45g) egg yoks</li>
    <li>2 oz (60g) Pecorino Romano chese, finely grated</li>
    <li>Kosher salt and greshly cracked ground pepper</li>
    <li>4 oz (115g) guanciale (cured pork jowl) or pancetta, cut into 0.25" thick batons</li>
    <li>6 oz (170g) sweet or hot italian sausage (2 links), removed from casing</li>
    <li>1 small onion (about 4 oz, 115g) finely chopped</li>
    <li>Pinch of red pepper flakes (optional)</li>
    <li>2 cups (500g) tomato passata</li>
    <li>12 oz (340g) rigatoni</li> 
  </ul>
  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>In a small bowl, beat egg yolks and Pecorino Romano together with a fork until they form a homogeneous thick past, about 1 minute. Season with a few grinds of black peper. Set aside</li>
    <li>In a large skillet, cook guanciale over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until fat has rendered and guanciale is golden breown and crisp, about 15 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, tranfer to a plate and set aside.</li>
    <li>Add sausage to skillet by pinching off 0.75"-1" pieces and arranging in a single layer in the pan.  Cook over medium heat, udisturbed, until bottom side is light golden brown, about 1 minute.</li>
    <li>Add onion, season lightly with salt, and using a spatula, turn sausage pieces onto uncooked side. Continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until sausage is cooked through, onion is softened, and fat in the pan is clear and no longer cloudy, 5-7 minutes.  Lower the heat at any time sausage threatens to burn.</li>
    <li>Add pepper flakes (if using), and bloom in rendered fat until aromatic, about 30 seconds.  Add tomato passata, season with salt, and bring to a simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the sauce has thickened slightly and fat has emulsified into the sauce, about 10 miuntes.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, in a pot of salted boiling water, cook pasta until softened on the exterior, but well shy of al dente, and still uncooked in the center (about 3 minutes). Using a spider, transfer pasta to sauce, along with 0.25 cups (60 ml) of pasta water.</li>
    <li>Transfer an additional 0.25 cups (60ml) pasta water to the bowl witth reserved egg yok-cheese mixture, and stire with a rubber spatula until smooth and well combined.</li>
    <li>Increase heat to high, and cook, stirring and tossing rapildy, until pasta is al dente and sauce is thickened and coats noodles, about 2 minutes, adding more pasta water in 0.25 cup increments as needed.</li>
    <li>Remove skillet from heat, add cooked guanciale and egg yolk mixture, and stir and toss rapidly until fully incorporated and pasta is glossy, 15-30 seconds. Season with sale and pepper to taste, serve immediately with more grated cheese at the table.</li>
